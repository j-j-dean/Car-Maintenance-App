# Car Maintenance App
I created this application to always know if my car needed maintenance just by updating the car's current 
mileage.  

## About this application
The program was written in Python version 3.6 to run on Windows.  Typically Python is invoked as a script.  
However, I created an executable version via PyInstaller that created an executable that can be downloaded 
and run directly.

# Instructions
Download the **carmaintmain.exe** file and run the executable.

Enter maintenance information for your car.

Now you too can always know if your car needs maintenance just by updating the car's current mileage.  Of course, 
your car might just be smart enough to tell you it needs assistance.
